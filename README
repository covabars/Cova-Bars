= Cova Bars

We're using Rails 2.3.11 now alongside Bundler. These steps should get you someway up and running.

    cd /path/to/cova-bars
    sudo gem install bundler
    bundle install
    rake db:create
    rake db:migrate
    script/server

This will go and get all the gem dependencies and you should hopefully have a working install.

= Changes

* I've upgraded the Rails version to 2.3.11 and added in Bundler which makes the gem dependency management way easier (checkout the Gemfile).
* Created the app on Heroku at http://cova-bars.heroku.com/ under the No More Art Heroku account.
* I've sent you a pull request to get my code changes on Github.
* You'll need to get the `heroku` command setup on your machine so you can do `git push heroku` to deploy stuff.

= Issues

== Seed Data
There's some seed data missing I thing (something to do with photos?) which meant the app was throwing an `undefined method for nil class`
error for me locally so couldn't actually see it running, but managed to get its environment set up enough for it to try and work.

== Heroku uses PostgreSQL
This means you can't use things like `ORDER BY RANDOM()` unless you specifically do the PostgreSQL equivalent in production. If you
checkout `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` you'll see this bit of code I added in to do just that:

    if (RAILS_ENV.to_sym == :production)
      @rcphoto = Photo.find(:first, :order => 'random()')
    else
      @rcphoto = Photo.find(:first, :order => 'RAND()')
    end
